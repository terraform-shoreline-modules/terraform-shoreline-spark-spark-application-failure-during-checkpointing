### About Shoreline
The Shoreline platform provides real-time monitoring, alerting, and incident automation for cloud operations. Use Shoreline to detect, debug, and automate repairs across your entire fleet in seconds with just a few lines of code.

Shoreline Agents are efficient and non-intrusive processes running in the background of all your monitored hosts. Agents act as the secure link between Shoreline and your environment's Resources, providing real-time monitoring and metric collection across your fleet. Agents can execute actions on your behalf -- everything from simple Linux commands to full remediation playbooks -- running simultaneously across all the targeted Resources.

Since Agents are distributed throughout your fleet and monitor your Resources in real time, when an issue occurs Shoreline automatically alerts your team before your operators notice something is wrong. Plus, when you're ready for it, Shoreline can automatically resolve these issues using Alarms, Actions, Bots, and other Shoreline tools that you configure. These objects work in tandem to monitor your fleet and dispatch the appropriate response if something goes wrong -- you can even receive notifications via the fully-customizable Slack integration.

Shoreline Notebooks let you convert your static runbooks into interactive, annotated, sharable web-based documents. Through a combination of Markdown-based notes and Shoreline's expressive Op language, you have one-click access to real-time, per-second debug data and powerful, fleetwide repair commands.

### What are Shoreline Op Packs?
Shoreline Op Packs are open-source collections of Terraform configurations and supporting scripts that use the Shoreline Terraform Provider and the Shoreline Platform to create turnkey incident automations for common operational issues. Each Op Pack comes with smart defaults and works out of the box with minimal setup, while also providing you and your team with the flexibility to customize, automate, codify, and commit your own Op Pack configurations.

# Spark application failure during checkpointing.
---

This incident type refers to a problem in a Spark application where it fails during the checkpointing process. Checkpointing is an important feature of Spark applications that allows for fault tolerance and recovery. When a checkpoint fails, it can cause data loss and potentially lead to application failure. This type of incident requires investigation to determine the root cause and implement a solution to prevent it from happening again.

### Parameters
```shell
export SPARK_APPLICATION_NAME="PLACEHOLDER"

export SPARK_APPLICATION_LOG_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"

export SPARK_APPLICATION_CONFIG_FILE="PLACEHOLDER"

export CHECKPOINTING_DIRECTORY="PLACEHOLDER"

export EXECUTOR_MEMORY="PLACEHOLDER"

export PATH_TO_SPARK_APP="PLACEHOLDER"

export DRIVER_MEMORY="PLACEHOLDER"

export AMOUNT_OF_RESOURCES_TO_ALLOCATE="PLACEHOLDER"
```

## Debug

### Check if Spark application is running
```shell
ps aux | grep ${SPARK_APPLICATION_NAME}
```

### Check the status of Spark application
```shell
sudo systemctl status ${SPARK_APPLICATION_NAME}
```

### Check if there are any logs generated by Spark
```shell
sudo tail -f /var/log/${SPARK_APPLICATION_LOG_FILE}
```

### Check if Spark is using the correct checkpointing directory
```shell
grep "spark.checkpoint.dir" ${SPARK_APPLICATION_CONFIG_FILE}
```

### Check if there is enough disk space in the checkpointing directory
```shell
df -h ${CHECKPOINTING_DIRECTORY}
```

### Check if the Spark checkpointing directory has the correct permissions
```shell
ls -l ${CHECKPOINTING_DIRECTORY}
```

### Check if the Spark application is configured to use enough memory
```shell
grep "spark.driver.memory" ${SPARK_APPLICATION_CONFIG_FILE}
```

### Check if the Spark application is configured to use enough cores
```shell
grep "spark.driver.cores" ${SPARK_APPLICATION_CONFIG_FILE}
```

### Check if the Spark application is using the correct version of Java
```shell
java -version
```

### Insufficient memory allocation for the Spark application, leading to checkpointing failures.
```shell


#!/bin/bash



# Set the Spark application name and memory allocation

SPARK_APP_NAME=${SPARK_APPLICATION_NAME}

SPARK_DRIVER_MEMORY=${DRIVER_MEMORY}

SPARK_EXECUTOR_MEMORY=${EXECUTOR_MEMORY}



# Check the available system memory

TOTAL_MEMORY=$(free -m | awk '/^Mem:/{print $2}')

USED_MEMORY=$(free -m | awk '/^Mem:/{print $3}')

AVAILABLE_MEMORY=$((TOTAL_MEMORY - USED_MEMORY))

echo "Total memory: ${TOTAL_MEMORY}MB"

echo "Used memory: ${USED_MEMORY}MB"

echo "Available memory: ${AVAILABLE_MEMORY}MB"



# Check if the requested memory allocation exceeds the available memory

if [[ $((SPARK_DRIVER_MEMORY + SPARK_EXECUTOR_MEMORY)) -gt $AVAILABLE_MEMORY ]]; then

    echo "Insufficient memory allocation for the Spark application"

    exit 1

fi



# Run the Spark application with the specified memory allocation

spark-submit --name ${SPARK_APP_NAME} --driver-memory ${SPARK_DRIVER_MEMORY} --executor-memory ${SPARK_EXECUTOR_MEMORY} ${PATH_TO_SPARK_APP}


```

## Repair

### Increase the resources allocated to the Spark application to mitigate potential resource contention issues.
```shell
bash

#!/bin/bash



# Set the variables

SPARK_APP_NAME=${SPARK_APPLICATION_NAME}

SPARK_APP_RESOURCES=${AMOUNT_OF_RESOURCES_TO_ALLOCATE}



# Stop the Spark application

sudo systemctl stop ${SPARK_APP_NAME}



# Update the resources allocated to the Spark application

sudo sed -i "s/\(SPARK_EXECUTOR_MEMORY=\).*/\1$SPARK_APP_RESOURCES/" /etc/${SPARK_APPLICATION_CONFIG_FILE}



# Start the Spark application

sudo systemctl start ${SPARK_APP_NAME}


```
